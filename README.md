# 🧠 QuontX-Inspired Societal-Financial Risk Modeling System

This project is a modular and extensible simulation engine designed to replicate how financial markets interact with societal behavior and policy dynamics. Inspired by QuontX’s mission to build a “virtual replica of reality,” this model blends time-series financial data, societal sentiment, and policy shock events to generate a dynamic risk score.

It is a foundation for building systems that can not only **simulate the now**, but **predict the next**—helping decision-makers act with foresight.

## ✨ Features

- ✅ Use **real-time financial data** from Yahoo Finance (`yfinance`)
- ✅ Simulate **societal sentiment signals** and **policy shocks**
- ✅ Modular architecture: data ingestion → scoring model → visualization
- ✅ Support for both **simulated** and **real-world** input
- ✅ Automatically **generates risk plots**
- ✅ Includes **test cases** for reproducibility

## ⚙️ Installation & Usage

### 🔧 1. Install Requirements

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

🚀 2. Run the Risk Modeling System

python main.py

By default, this runs a simulated pipeline. You can also drop in real data (data/real_market_data.csv), and the system will auto-detect and use it.


🧪 3. Run a Test Case

python tests/test_real_data_pipeline.py

⸻

📊 Output

Running the model will generate: 
real_risk_model_output.png

This includes:
	•	📈 Market Price trend
	•	💬 Sentiment score overlayed with policy shocks
	•	🧠 Computed dynamic Risk Score

Optionally, you can export the full simulation as a CSV for further analysis or reporting.

💡 Inspired by QuontX

QuontX envisions technology that transcends traditional AI by deeply understanding and simulating the complex interactions in our world—social, economic, and behavioral.

This project is a first step toward building such a living model of reality, where we can test assumptions, forecast futures, and make smarter, systemic decisions.
