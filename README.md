# 🧠 Societal-Financial Dynamics Risk Scoring System

This project is a modular and extensible simulation engine that models the interplay between financial markets, societal sentiment, and policy dynamics. By blending time-series signals across these domains, it generates a dynamic risk score to capture systemic behavior in complex environments.

It is a foundation for building systems that can not only **simulate the now**, but **predict the next**—helping decision-makers act with foresight.


## ✨ Features

- ✅ Use **real-time financial data** from Yahoo Finance (`yfinance`)
- ✅ Simulate **societal sentiment signals** and **policy shocks**
- ✅ Modular architecture: data ingestion → scoring model → visualization
- ✅ Support for both **simulated** and **real-world** input
- ✅ Automatically **generates risk plots**
- ✅ Includes **test cases** for reproducibility

## ⚙️ Installation & Usage

### 🔧 1. Install Requirements

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 🚀 2. Run the Risk Modeling System

```bash
python main.py
```
By default, this runs a simulated pipeline. You can also drop in real data (data/real_market_data.csv), and the system will auto-detect and use it.


### 🧪 3. Run a Test Case

```bash
python tests/test_real_data_pipeline.py
```

## 📊 Output

Running the model will generate: 
real_risk_model_output.png

This includes:
	•	📈 Market Price trend
	•	💬 Sentiment score overlayed with policy shocks
	•	🧠 Computed dynamic Risk Score

Optionally, you can just go ahead and export the full simulation as a CSV for further analysis or reporting.

## 💡 Inspired by next-generation approaches to systemic modeling

The goal is to transcend static AI predictions by developing models that reflect the dynamic, interdependent nature of our world—socially, economically, and behaviorally.

This project is a first step toward building such a living model of reality, where we can test assumptions, forecast futures, and make smarter, systemic decisions.
